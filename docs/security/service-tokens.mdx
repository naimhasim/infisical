## Background

Many clients use service tokens to authenticate and read/write secrets from/to Infisical.

Each service token consist of two parts used for authentication and decryption, separated by `.`. Consider the token `st.abc.def.ghi`. Here, `st.abc.def` can be used to authenticate with the API, by including it in the `Authorization` header under `Bearer st.abc.def`, and retrieve (encrypted) secrets as well as a project key back. Meanwhile, `ghi`, a hex-string, can be used to decrypt the project key used to decrypt the secrets.

Note that when using service tokens via select client methods like SDK or CLI, cryptographic operations are abstracted for you that is the token is parsed and encryption/decryption operations are handled. If using service tokens with the REST API and end-to-end encryption enabled, then you will have to handle the encryption/decryption operations yourself.

## Recommendations

1. Issuance: When creating a new service token, itâ€™s important to consider the [principle of least privilege(PoLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) when setting its scope and expiration date. For example, if the client using the token only requires access to a staging environment, then you should scope the token to that environment only; you can further scope tokens to path(s) within environment(s) if you happen to use [path-based secret storage](/documentation/platform/folder). Likewise, if the client does not intend to access secrets indefinitely, then you may consider setting a finite lifetime for the token such as 6 months or 1 year from now. Finally, you should consider carefully whether or not your client requires the ability to read and/or write secrets from/to Infisical.

2. Network access: We recommend configuring the IP whitelist settings of each project to allow either single IP addresses or CIDR-notated range of addresses to read/write secrets to Infisical. With this feature, you can specify the IP range of your client servers to restrict access to your project in Infisical.

3. Storage: Since service tokens grant access to your secrets, we recommend storing service tokens securely across your development cycle whether it be in a `.env` file in local development or as an environment variable of your deployment platform.

4. Rotation: We recommend periodically rotating the service token, even in the absence of compromise. Since service tokens are capable of decrypting project keys used to decrypt secrets, all of which use AES-256-GCM encryption, they should be rotated before approximately 2^32 encryptions have been performed; this follows the guidance set forth by NIST publication 800-38D. Note that Infisical keeps track of the number of times that service tokens are used and will alert you when you have reached 90% of the recommended capacity.
